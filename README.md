Components:

InputForm: This component handles user input for the simulation parameters. It defines state variables for various parameters like total tickets, release rate, etc. It also has functions to handle user input changes and trigger simulation start/stop/check status.
SimulationDisplay: This component displays the simulation details after it's run. It retrieves the details from the backend and displays information like execution time, vendor tickets added, and customer tickets retrieved.
Interfaces:

SimulationParameters: This interface defines the expected structure for the simulation parameters.
SimulationDetails: This interface defines the structure of the data received from the backend after a simulation run.
App.js: This file is the main entry point for the React application. It renders both the InputForm and SimulationDisplay components.

index.js: This file sets up the React application using createRoot and renders the App component in strict mode.

Styling:

There are separate CSS files for styling the InputForm component and the overall application layout. They define styles for font family, colors, buttons, and responsiveness.

Missing Part:

The provided code doesn't seem to include the backend logic (presumably running on port 8080) that handles the actual simulation logic and interacts with the API calls made by axios.

Overall:

This code provides a user interface for setting up and interacting with a ticket simulation. It demonstrates concepts like managing user input, handling state, making API calls with axios, and displaying simulation results.
